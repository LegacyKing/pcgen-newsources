GLIMPSE THE TRUTH
	INFO:PowerLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting
	DURATION:1 round
You see things within 30 feet as they truly are. The GM attempts
a special secret dispel check against any illusion in the area, but
only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it (for
instance, if the check succeeds against an illusory disguise spell, you
see the creature's true form but it doesn't end the illusory disguise).
GLITTERDUST
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust, with an effect
depending on their Reflex save results. If a creature has its invisibility
negated by this spell, it is concealed instead of invisible. This applies
both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from new
invisibility effects before the invisibility negation effect runs out.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target's invisibility is negated for 1 round.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.

GLOBE OF INVULNERABILITY
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	TARGETAREA:10-foot burst centered on one corner of your space
	DURATION:1 minute
You create an immobile globe around you that attempts to dispel
any spell from outside the globe whose area or targets enter into
the globe, as if the globe were a dispel magic spell 1 level lower
than its actual spell level. Even if the dispel attempt succeeds, it
prevents only the portion of the spell that would have entered the
globe (so if the spell also had targets outside the globe or part of
its area were beyond the globe, those targets or area would still
be affected normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken
open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or
objects or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the area
afterward normally).
GLUTTON'S JAWS
	INFO:PowerLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting

GLYPH OF WARDING

	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one container or 10-foot-by-10-foot area
	DURATION:unlimited until dismissed
While Casting this Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level
to stored in the glyph. The stored spell must take 3 actions or
fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have
an area. You can set the glyph with a password, a trigger stimulus, or both. Any creature that opens the target container or enters the
target area without speaking the password or matching the trigger
stimulus activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within.
Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits
of that spell. If the spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the
creature that set off the glyph. If the spell has an area, that area is
centered on the creature that set off the glyph. Glyph of warding's
duration ends when the glyph is triggered. The glyph counts as a
magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to
notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require
the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.
You can dismiss glyph of warding with a Verbal Casting action.
The maximum number of glyphs of warding you can have active at
a time is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

You conjure greasy goo, with effects based on your target.
• Target an Area Each creature within the area must attempt
an Acrobatics check to Maintain Balance against your spell
DC. Creatures later entering a square within the area must
also attempt an Acrobatics check to Balance. A creature that
takes a Step doesn't have to Balance.
• Target an Object If you cast the spell on an unattended
object, those trying to pick up the object must succeed at an
Acrobatics check against your spell DC to do so. If you target an
attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt
an Acrobatics check. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes
a –2 circumstance penalty to any attack roll or to any check
attempted that involves using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder drops the item. The object lands in an
adjacent square of the GM's choice. If the object is worn, the
wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving
throws against attempts to grapple or shove them.
GUIDANCE CANTRIP

	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:until the start of your next turn or until dismissed
You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 conditional
bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill
check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target

HALLUCINATION
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 hour
The target consistently believes one thing is another, can't detect
something that's there, or detects something that's not there. You
choose which of these options applies and determine the specifics
of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target think
all elves are humans, be unable to detect the presence of his
brother, think his beloved pocket watch is always on his person
even when it isn't, or believe there's a tower in the center of town.
The target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination
every time he Seeks or Interacts with the subject of the hallucination.
For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve each time he
encountered an elf, bumped into his brother accidentally, tried to
check his pocket watch, or studied the tower to spot vulnerabilities.
The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance
bonus in circumstances determined by the GM, such as if the target
attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.

You create an illusion that causes natural terrain to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of terrain. This doesn't
disguise any structures or creatures in the area.
Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the Seek action

You hurl a held melee weapon at the target, making a ranged Strike

• Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
You disperse negative energy in a 30-foot aura. This has the

it solid, for instance in order to climb onto it. Even incorporeal
creatures who fail to disbelieve the wall can't pass through it.
A creature who disbelieves is bolstered against your house of

	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:10 minutes or until dismissed
You transform your appearance to look like a Small or Medium
humanoid, such as a drow, dwarf, elf, goblin, halfling, human, orc, or lizardfolk. You count as a humanoid in addition to your normal
traits while in this form, as well as gaining any trait related to the
creature's kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation
reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (using the
effects of the shrink spell). This transformation doesn't change
your statistics in any way. You can still wear and use your gear, and it changes size to match your new form if necessary. The
item's size change ends immediately if the item leaves your person.

damage equal to 1d10 plus your Strength modifier.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The stone's base damage increases by 1d10.
HYPERCOGNITION
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting
You rapidly catalog and collate information relevant to your
current situation. You can instantly use up to 10 Recall
Knowledge actions as part of Casting this Spell. If you have any
special abilities or free actions that would trigger when you
Recall Knowledge, you can't use them for these actions.
HYPNOTIC PATTERN
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting
	RANGE:120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must
attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast
it, when it enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or
uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently
fascinated by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.
	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is fascinated by the pattern.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target is fascinated by the pattern. While
it remains fascinated, it can't take reactions.
ILLUSORY CREATURE
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:500 feet
	DURATION:concentration
You create an illusory image of a Huge or smaller creature. It
makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels
right to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500
feet apart, the spell ends.
The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak
through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as
appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance
check to convincingly mimic the creature, as determined by the
GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific
person and engage with someone that person knows.
In combat, the illusion counts as a creature for flanking. It uses
your spell roll for attack rolls and saving throws and your spell
DC for its AC. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the
spell is dismissed. The creature has two actions per turn, which it
takes when you Concentrate on the Spell.
The illusion can't directly affect the physical world, though
its attacks can cause damage by making the target believe
they're real. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the
target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting
ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are
nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the
monster-for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage-
the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check
to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances
and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged
by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and
attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature
would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does
not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a
certain damage type.
Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek
action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half
the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any
further damage from it. The GM should track illusory damage
dealt by the illusion.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The damage of the image's Strikes increases by
1d4 and the maximum size of creature you can create increases
by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).
ILLUSORY DISGUISE
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 hour or until dismissed
Your illusion can make you appear as another creature of the
same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and
weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise is typically good enough
to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual.
The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You
can also make clothing and items you wear appear different, such
as making your armor look like an ordinary dress. Held items are
unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true
appearance until you don it again.
	INFO:Casting|illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for
the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance
penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar
creature, and it gives you a +4 conditional bonus to your
Deception checks to avoid others seeing through your disguise.
You can dismiss this disguise with a Verbal Casting action.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) You can appear as any creature of the same

	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:500 feet; Area 20-foot burst
	DURATION:10 minutes
You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The
entire image must fit within the spell's area. The object appears
to animate naturally, but it doesn't make sounds or generate
smells. For example, water would appear to pour down an
illusory waterfall, but it would be silent.
Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action
to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell
gains the auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) As the 2nd-level version, but the duration
is unlimited.
ILLUSORY SCENE
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Verbal, Somatic)
	RANGE:500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
	DURATION:1 hour
You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete
creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be
within the spell's area. These elements all generate appropriate
sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements
of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike the illusory
creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and
statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment
around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory
environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell.
When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be
static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. Wind blowing on an illusory
piece of paper would rustle it, for example. A program can be
up to 1 minute long, and it repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a programmed scene of two orcs fighting each
other, and their fight would go the same way for each repetition.
If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place
at the start of the fight and at the end of it, but you can smooth
the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends or begins.
However, anyone observing long term almost always notices the
program looping. You're unable to alter the program after you
create the illusion.
Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the
Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
If they were interacting with a portion of the illusion, they
disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene
only on a critical success.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.
You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating
your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor
as appropriate.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) Per 6th-level, and the duration is unlimited.

INSECT FORM
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You transform into a Medium animal battle form. You count as an
animal in addition to your normal traits while in this form. Your
gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your
gear still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When
you transform, you gain the following:
• Low-light vision.
• Treat your Athletics bonus as +12, unless your own bonus is
already higher.

in the insect types below, which are the only types of attacks
you can use. You're trained with them. When attacking with
them, your attack modifier is +10 and your damage bonus is
+2. These are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the
enfeebled condition, for example).
The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or
using most actions with the manipulate trait that require hands
(the GM determines which actions of this sort you can take if
there's doubt).You can dismiss this spell with a Concentrate on
the Spell action.
If you prepare this spell, choose from the following options.
When in battle form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and
special abilities listed. You can choose a more specific type of
animal to turn into (such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle). This
has no effect on your battle form's size or statistics.
• Ant mandibles, Damage 2d6 bludgeoning; Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet.
• Beetle mandibles, Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; Speed 25 feet.
• Centipede darkvision; mandibles, Damage 1d8 piercing plus
1d4 persistent poison; Speed 25 feet, climb 25 feet.
• Mantis scent; foreleg, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning; Speed 40 feet.

	TARGETAREA:one ally
	DURATION:1 round
Your encouraging words inspire your ally to
succeed at a task. You count as having taken
sufficient preparatory actions to Aid your ally on a skill check of
your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you take the
Aid reaction to aid that ally on the chosen skill check, you can
roll Performance instead of the normal check, and if you would
fail or critically fail to Aid, you succeed instead. If you have
legendary proficiency in Performance, you instead automatically
critically succeed.
The GM might rule that you can't use this ability if the act of
encouraging your ally would interfere with the ally's skill check
(like encouraging an ally to Sneak quietly, Lie to the king, or
maintain a disguise).

a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your
inspire courage depends on the result of your check.
	DESC:&nl;Success The spell bonus from inspire courage increases to +2.

The target becomes invisible. This makes it unseen to all

You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as
you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made invisible
by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and
remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature
made invisible by this spell acts in a hostile manner, the spell
is dismissed after that hostile action, reaction, free action, or
activity is completed.
While exploring, it's easy to move together and remain
invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an

	DURATION:24 hours
You conjure an extradimensional demiplane consisting of a
spacious dwelling with a single entrance. The entrance connects
back to the plane where you cast the spell, appearing where you
choose within the spell's range. It appears as a faint, shimmering, vertical rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate who
can enter when you cast the spell. Once you enter the portal, you
can shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and creatures you
designated can reopen the door at will with the Interact action, just
like opening a physical door. Other creatures must use extraplanar
travel, such as plane shift, in order to enter the mansion.
Inside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion with a
magnificent foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The mansion
can have any floor plan you imagine as you cast the spell, provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet deep, and 30
feet tall. While the entrance is closed, effects from outside the
mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa. You can use scrying
magic and similar effects to observe the outside only if they're
capable of crossing planes.
A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the
mansion. These are like the servant created by the unseen
servant spell, though they're visible, with an appearance you
determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough
food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.
MARINER'S CURSE

to 0 ends the curse.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.

MASK OF TERROR
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting

creature to anyone observing it. The effect is
Transmutation

unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might
see a demon with bloody fangs and a demon observing the target
might see a glowing angelic visage.
When any creature attempts a hostile action or reaction against
the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. Once it does, it
doesn't need to attempt another save against mask of terror for
any actions or reactions it spends until the end of its next turn.
	DESC:&nl;Success The creature is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The creature becomes frightened 2 before taking its
action or reaction.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The creature becomes frightened 2 and its
action or reaction fails and is wasted.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature
spends an action or reaction that affects multiple targets
simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask
of terror.
MASTER'S ILLUSION
	INFO:PowerLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Verbal Casting

MAZE
	INFO:SpellLevel|8
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 minutes or
until dismissed
When you cast maze, you transport the target into an
extradimensional maze of eldritch origin. Once each turn, the
target can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check against
your spell DC to escape the maze.
The possible outcomes of the Survival check are as follows.
	DESC:&nl;Success The creature is on the right path to the exit. If the
target was already on the right path, it escapes the maze
and the spell ends.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The creature escapes and the spell ends.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The creature makes no progress toward escape.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The creature makes no progress toward
escape, and if it was on the right path it no longer is.
Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless
the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift. When
the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration
ran out, the target returns in the space it occupied when it was
banished, or the nearest space if the original space is now filled.
It loses any remaining actions it would have on its current turn, but it can spend reactions normally.
MELD INTO STONE
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:10 minutes or until dismissed
You merge with an adjacent block of stone with enough volume
to fit you and your worn and held possessions. You must touch
this stone when you cast the spell. You can cast spells while in the
stone as long as they don't require line of effect beyond the stone, and you can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the stone.
Significant physical damage to the stone while you are inside
expels you and deals 10d6 damage to you. Passwall expels you
without dealing damage and dismisses meld into stone. You can
dismiss this spell with a Verbal Casting action.

MESSAGE CANTRIP
	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:see below
You mouth words, but instead of coming out of
your mouth, they're transferred to the ears of the
target. Though others cannot hear your words, the target can as
if she were standing next to you. She can give a brief response as
a reaction, or as a free action on her next turn if she wishes, but
she must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If she
responds, per the original missive only you can hear her response.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (3rd) The spell's range increases to 500 feet.
METAMAGICIAN'S SHORTCUT
	INFO:PowerLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 hour
When you cast this spell, choose a metamagic feat you have.
The next time you trigger that feat, you don't need to add a
Somatic Casting action to the spell you cast. Metamagician's
shortcut ends when this happens. You can't have more than one
metamagician's shortcut active at a time, and if you cast it again
the previous one ends.
METEOR SWARM
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:500 feet; Area four 40-foot bursts
You call down four blazing meteors that explode. Each meteor deals
3d10 bludgeoning damage to any creatures in the 10-foot burst at
the center of each area of effect; the meteor then explodes, dealing
14d6 fire damage to any creatures in each 40-foot burst. The
meteors' central 10-foot bursts can't overlap, and a creature takes
the same amount of fire damage no matter how many overlapping
explosions it's caught in. Each creature in the area can attempt a
Reflex saving throw, which applies to both types of damage.
	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage.

You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends
you off with a Will save.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Each round of the probe's duration, you ask a different
question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each
question, the target can attempt a Deception check against
your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the
answer, and on a critical success, the target sends you a
false answer that you believe is a truthful answer.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but the target takes a –4
circumstance penalty to Deception checks against
questions you ask as part of the probe.
MIND READING
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet

You read the target's mind, depending on its Will save. Once you
cast mind reading on a target, you can't target that creature again
until the duration ends.
	DESC:&nl;Success You find out whether the target's Intelligence is
higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target perceives vague surface thoughts
from you when you cast the spell.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target
when you cast the spell, and you find out whether its
Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, and for the duration of the spell, you

You link your mind to the target's mind and mentally impart to
that target an amount of information in an instant that could
otherwise be communicated in 10 minutes.
MIRACLE
	INFO:SpellLevel|10
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
You form a direct connection with your divine source and request
intercession. Your divine source always refuses a request out of
line with its nature and might choose to grant a different request
(potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the
one you asked for. A miracle can do any of the following things.
• Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower.
• Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower.
• Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the
above effects.
The GM might allow you to try using miracle to produce
greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or
the spell may have only a partial effect.
MIRROR IMAGE
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
Three illusory images swirl about your space, potentially causing
those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any
attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of
your images instead. If you have all three images up, there is a 1 in
4 chance of hitting you (1 on a 1d4). With two images up, there is a
1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2 on a 1d6). With only one image the
chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on a 1d6). If an image is hit, it is destroyed.
If the attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the
images, it becomes a success against you and one of the images
is also destroyed. Once all the images are destroyed, the spell
is dismissed.
MISDIRECTION
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:two creatures or objects
	DURATION:1 day or until dismissed
You designate one target as the primary target and the other
as the secondary target. All effects that would detect auras on
the primary target instead detect the same types of auras from
the secondary target. A creature reading the aura can attempt
to disbelieve the illusion. You can dismiss the spell with a Verbal
	INFO:Casting|action from up to a mile away.
MISLEAD
	INFO:SpellLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of
yourself. When you Concentrate on the Spell, you can mentally
dictate a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round.
Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions, though it can't actually affect anything in the environment.
Both the invisibility and the duplicate remain as long as you
concentrate. Per a 4th-level invisibility spell, committing a
hostile action doesn't end mislead's invisibility. A creature that
determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn't necessarily know
you're invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn't
necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion.
If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another
creature, you can attempt a Deception check as part of that
action against observers' Perception DCs to convince them
your duplicate took that action. This doesn't fool anyone who's
aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack
obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, Illusion
Visual
Illusion
Illusion
if you fired a ray you could make it look like it came from the
duplicate, if the duplicate is positioned appropriately, but if you
attack with a staff and your duplicate is across the room from the
target, your attempt at deception would fail.
MODIFY MEMORY
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:permanent
You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory's clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false
memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was
something harmless instead of modify memory, unless
it identifies the spell (usually by spending the Identify
Magic action).
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected and realizes you tried
to alter its memory.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -During the first 5 minutes of the spell's duration, you
can Concentrate on the Spell to modify a memory once
each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of
memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes
of memory.
Any memories you've altered remain changed as long as the spell
is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is
up, you can't alter any further memories.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) You can cast the spell on a willing target in
order to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50
words or fewer. The spell patches these omissions with indistinct
haze. Instead of having a duration, the effects last indefinitely
even in the absence of magic and can be removed only by
powerful spells such as alter reality.
MOMENT OF RENEWAL
	INFO:SpellLevel|8
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
The target experiences a day's worth of recovery in an instant. Any
detrimental effects that would be gone after 24 hours end, though
this doesn't shorten the duration of any active spells affecting the
target. The target regains Hit Points and recovers from conditions
as if it had taken 24 hours of rest. The creature doesn't regain
spells for resting or get other benefits of rest other than healing.
The target is then bolstered against all moment of renewal spells.
MONEY TALKS
	INFO:PowerLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic free action; Trigger You Cast a

MONSTROSITY FORM
	INFO:SpellLevel|8
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming
a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into
or the spell is lost. You count as an animal in addition to your
normal traits while in this form. Your gear is absorbed into your
form; your constant abilities of your gear still function, but you
can't activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain
the following:
• AC 36 (TAC 33) and ignore your armor's check penalty and
Speed reduction.
• One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only
types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them.
When attacking with them, your attack modifier is +26 and

Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled
condition, for example).
• 20 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your
battle form.
• Darkvision.
• Athletics +27 (unless your own total modifier is higher).
The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or
using most actions with the manipulate trait that require your
hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can
spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an
action (this action has the concentrate trait).
When you prepare this spell, choose the creature you wish to
turn into from the following options. When in battle form, you
gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed.
• Phoenix beak (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d6+12 piercing plus
2d4 fire and 2d4 persistent fire; talon (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8+12 slashing; Speed 30 feet, fly 90 feet; Shroud

feet from you. A creature that enters or ends its turn within
the aura takes 2d6 fire damage. A creature can take this

hampered and immobilized and ignore difficult terrain and
greater difficult terrain.
• Sea Serpent jaws (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d12+20 piercing;
tail (reach 25 feet), Damage 2d8+20 bludgeoning; Speed 20
feet, swim 90 feet; Spine Rake: You can spend a move action
to extend your spines and swim or Stride. Each creature
you're adjacent to at any point during your movement takes

A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and
savage. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, are accelerated 10, and
Morph

gain weakness 5 to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, both of which are unarmed attacks. The fangs deal 3d8 piercing
damage; the claws deal 3d6 slashing damage and have the agile
and finesse traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed
attack proficiency with these attacks. On a critical hit with one of
these weapons, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage.
The targets can't spend concentrate actions unless those
actions have the rage trait. Their Seek actions gain the rage trait
during the spell's duration. A creature can attempt to end the
spell's effect on themself by spending an action and attempting a
Will save against your spell DC.
If a target is in the light of a full moon, they also grow by one
size if they were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a
Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 10, the silver
weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by the attacks to four dice.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 15, the silver

a ranged touch attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 1d6 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier

dim light, but any magical script or arcane symbols in the area
glow a slightly brighter blue, granting a +1 circumstance bonus
to Perception checks to Seek them. Magical ink visible only in
moonlight also appears in an area of moonlight glow.
MYSTIC BEACON

functions at its actual level.
NATURE INCARNATE
	INFO:SpellLevel|10
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You transform into an incarnation of nature, assuming a battle
form: Medium for a green man and Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot
space) for a kaiju. You must have enough space to expand into or
the spell is lost. You count as a plant if you choose green man or as
a beast if you choose kaiju in addition to your normal traits while
in this form. Your gear is absorbed into your form; your constant
abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any item
abilities. When you transform, you gain the following:
• AC 43 (TAC 39) and ignore your armor's check penalty and
Speed reduction.
• One or more natural attacks, which are the only types
of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. When
attacking with them, your attack modifier is +31 and the
damage bonus is listed with your attacks. Melee attacks
you gain are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of
the enfeebled condition, for example), and ranged attacks
you gain are Dexterity-based attacks. They all target the
enemy's AC.
• 30 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your
battle form.
• Darkvision.
• Athletics +32 (unless your own total modifier is higher).
The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.

actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM
determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's
doubt). You can dismiss this spell with a concentrate action.

on a critical failure).
NATURE'S BOUNTY

Requirement You can cast this spell only in a
natural area that supports significant plant life.
You call forth nature's bounty, providing enough clean water and
fresh fruits and vegetables to sustain one human for a day. If you
have a pool of Spell Points, you can spend more Spell Points to
sustain an additional human for each additional Spell Point you
spend. Most Medium creatures eat the same amount as a human
each day. Most Small creatures eat 1/4 as much as a human (1/16
as much for most Tiny creatures, and so on), and most Large
creatures eat 10 times as much as a human (100 times as much

NATURE'S ENMITY
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:100 feet
	TARGETAREA:up to five creatures
	DURATION:10 minutes
Animals, plants and weather in the area turn against the targets.
Each target suffers from the following effects.
• Vegetation springs up from any surface, making targets
entangled any time they're adjacent to a plant or a surface
of stone or earth.
• Aggressive animals attack unpredictably then depart. At
the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On
a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10
slashing damage. The target can attempt a Reflex save, taking
half damage on a success, no damage on a critical success, or
double damage on a critical failure. The target is flat-footed
for 1 round on any result other than a critical success.
• The target also loses any connection to nature or natural
creatures. Any animal or plant creature becomes hostile to
it, even a companion creature like an animal companion.
The target also has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when
casting any primal spell or the spell fails.
The GM might determine that you can't subject some
creatures to the ire of nature. For example, a primal spellcaster
of your level or higher or an avatar of nature might be immune
to these effects.

	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
You afflict the target with a curse that makes its
presence off-putting and grating, depending on the
outcome of its Will save.
	DESC:&nl;Success Per failure, but the effect ends on its own after 1
minute instead.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target must roll twice and use the worse result
whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and all creatures she encounters have
an initial attitude toward her of one step worse (for instance, unfriendly instead of indifferent). The effect is permanent.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but all creatures the target encounters
have an initial attitude towards her of two steps worse.
OVERWHELMING PRESENCE
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	TARGETAREA:40-foot burst
	TARGETAREA:any number of creatures
	DURATION:until full tribute is paid
You surround yourself with a supernatural
splendor, appearing to be a god or similarly majestic being. You
choose the particular majestic aspects of your new appearance.
This causes the targets to pay tribute to you by bowing or
spending some other action in keeping with your appearance.
The number of times they must do this depends on the outcome
of their Will saves.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target must pay tribute two times.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target must pay tribute six times.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, and the target must spend all
actions paying tribute if possible.
Paying tribute is a manipulate action or move action, as
chosen by the creature paying tribute. A creature under this
effect must pay tribute to you at least once on each of its turns
if possible. While under this spell, a creature is fascinated by
you and can't act in a hostile fashion toward you. The target is
bolstered against your overwhelming presence.
PALADIN'S SACRIFICE
	INFO:PowerLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting; Trigger The targeted
creature is hit or critically hit by a Strike, or the target fails
or critically fails a saving throw against an effect that doesn't
affect you.
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one ally
You take all the effects of the hit, critical hit, failed save, or
critically failed save instead of the ally. These effects ignore any
resistances, immunities, or other abilities you have that might
mitigate them in any way.
PARALYZE
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one humanoid creature
	DURATION:varies
You attempt to paralyze the target, potentially freezing it in
place, depending on the outcome of the target's Will save.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is paralyzed for 1 round.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds. At the
start of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to
reduce the remaining duration by 1 round or end it entirely
on a critical success.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) You can target a humanoid or non-humanoid
creature.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) You can target up to 10 humanoid creatures.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) You can target up to 10 creatures, and they
don't have to be humanoids.
PARANOIA
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 minute
The target is stricken by intense paranoia towards all creatures
around it, with effects determined by the outcome of its Will
saving throw.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target believes everyone it sees is a potential
threat. It becomes unfriendly to all creatures that were
previously allies, treating only itself as an ally. The spell
ends after 1 round.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Per success, but the effect lasts the full minute.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, except the target believes that

everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions
and free actions against these enemies regardless of
whether they were previously its allies, as determined by
the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as normal and will
likely prefer to attack enemies that are actively attacking
or hindering it.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) You can target up to five creatures.
PASS WITHOUT TRACE
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 hour
You reduce the tracks you leave behind, adding a +4 conditional
bonus to the DC needed to track you, or setting the DC of
tracking you equal to the spell's DC, whichever is higher. You can
gain only one of these two benefits; casting pass without trace
multiple times doesn't improve the DC further.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) The duration increases to 8 hours.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) The duration increases to 8 hours. The spell
has a 20-foot range and a 20-foot aura area, affecting up to 10
creatures of your choice within that area.
PASSWALL
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch; Area 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 10-footdeep
section of wooden, plaster, or stone wall
	DURATION:1 hour
You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area, replacing the area with empty space; if the wall is thicker than
10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal in
the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell doesn't
reduce the integrity of the structure, so the wall doesn't collapse
even if it's load-bearing. When the spell ends, anyone inside the
tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep.
The areas of the wall that contain your tunnel's entrance
(and exit, if applicable) appear completely normal (unless
subjected to true seeing), despite the tunnel's existence. The
tunnel's entrance normally counts as a solid wall, but you can
specify a password or a trigger stimulus. Anyone speaking
the password or fulfilling the trigger stimulus can enter the
tunnel freely.
PERFECTED FORM
	INFO:PowerLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting; Trigger You fail or
critically fail a saving throw against a petrification
or polymorph effect.
Reroll the saving throw and use whichever result was better.
PERFECTED MIND
	INFO:PowerLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
You meditate upon perfection to remove all distractions from
your mind. Attempt another Will save against one mental
effect currently affecting you that required a Will save. If the
new save would have a worse result than the original save, nothing happens. You can use perfected mind only once against
a particular effect.
PEST FORM
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:10 minutes or until dismissed
You transform into a Tiny nonthreatening animal, such as a cat, rat, insect, or lizard. You count as an animal in addition to your
normal traits while in this form. You can choose the specific type
of animal you turn into (such as a rat or praying mantis). This
has no effect on your battle form's size or statistics. Your gear
is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear
still function, but you can't activate any item abilities. When you
transform, you gain the following abilities:
• AC 13 (TAC 13) and ignore your armor's check penalty and
Speed reduction.
• One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only
types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them.
When attacking with them, your attack modifier is +6
and your attacks deal 1 piercing damage (or another type
depending on your form, as the GM sees fit). These are
Dexterity-based attacks (for the purposes of the sluggish
condition, for example).
• Weakness 5 to all physical damage. (If you take physical
damage while in this form, you take 5 additional damage.)
• Speed 10 feet.
• Low-light vision, scent.
• Acrobatics +10 and Stealth +10 (unless your own total
modifiers are higher); Athletics –4.
The special statistics of your pest form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
Your pest form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or
spending most actions with the manipulate trait that require
your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you
can spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an
action (this action has the concentrate trait).
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) You can turn into a flying creature, such as a
bird. You also gain a fly Speed of 20 feet.
PHANTASMAL CALAMITY
	INFO:SpellLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each
target. Each creature in the area sees its own version of
the calamity tailored to its worst fears, and must attempt
a Will saving throw. This vision deals 11d6 mental damage
and inflicts other effects, depending on the outcome of each
creature's saving throw.
	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success Unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Double damage and the creature falls prone.
It must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or believe it's
trapped (fallen into a crevasse, adrift at sea, or some other
fate depending on its vision). If it fails, it's stunned for 1
minute. It gets a new Will save at the end of each of its
turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the illusion and
recovers from stunned.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.

PHANTASMAL KILLER
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet
	TARGETAREA:one living creature
You create a phantasmal image of the most
fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only
the spell's target can see the killer, though you can
see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The
effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target's Will
saving throw.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target is frightened 1.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target is so afraid it might instantly die.
It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; if the target
fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies. On a successful
Fortitude save, the target still takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is frightened 4.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The damage on a failure increases by 2d6 and on
a critical failure by 3d6.
PHANTOM PAIN
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting

	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 minute
Pain wracks the target, dealing 1d4 mental damage and 1d4
persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will
saving throw.
	DESC:&nl;Success Full damage, but no persistent damage and the spell
ends immediately.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage, and the target is sick 1. If the target
recovers from being sick, its persistent mental damage
ends as well and the spell ends.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but the target is sick 2.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d4 and the persistent
damage by 1.
PHANTOM STEED
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:30 feet
	DURATION:8 hours or until dismissed
You conjure a Large, magical, horselike creature that only you
(or another Medium or Small creature you choose when casting
the spell) can ride. The horse is clearly phantasmal in nature, has 18 AC and 10 Hit Points, and automatically fails all saves. If
reduced to 0 Hit Points, it disappears and the spell is dismissed.
The steed has a Speed of 40 feet and can hold your body weight
(or the body weight of the creature you chose) plus 20 Bulk.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) The steed has a Speed of 60 feet, can walk on
water, and ignores areas of natural difficult terrain.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) The steed has a Speed of 60 feet, can walk on
water, and ignores areas of natural difficult terrain. It can also
walk on air (per air walk) but must end its turn on solid ground
or fall.

PHYSICAL BOOST
	INFO:PowerLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one living creature
	DURATION:until the end of the target's next turn or until dismissed
You temporarily improve the target's physique. The target gains a
1d4 conditional bonus to the next Acrobatics, Athletics, or Stealth
roll it attempts. Once it uses this bonus, the spell is dismissed.
PLANE SHIFT
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one willing creature, or up to
eight willing creatures joining hands
The target or targets move to another dimensional plane, such as the Plane of Fire, the Shadow Plane, Hell, or the
Abyss. Attempting to reach a particular plane requires specific
knowledge of the plane and a magic tuning fork created from
material from that plane; while the tuning forks for most
prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane
shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare
tuning forks.
The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25 miles
from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located
the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time
traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a
random location on the plane, though you can use other means of
transit, such as teleport, to travel while on the new plane. Plane
shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting
plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane
unless there are extenuating circumstances.
PLANT FORM
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You transform into a Large plant battle form.
You count as a plant in addition to your normal traits while
in this form. Your gear is absorbed into your form; the
constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't
activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the
following abilities:
• AC (TAC 24) and ignore your armor's check penalty and
Speed reduction.
• One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only types
of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. When
attacking with them, your attack modifier is +15 and your
damage bonus is +11. These are Strength-based attacks (for
the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example).
• 12 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your
battle form.
• Resistance 10 to poison.
• Low-light vision.
• Athletics +17 (unless your own total modifier is higher).
The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or
spending most action with the manipulate trait that require your
hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can

spend if there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an
action (this action has the concentrate trait).
When you prepare this spell, choose the creature you wish to
turn into from the following options. When in battle form, you
gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed.
You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as
a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap). This has no effect on your
battle form's size or statistics.
• Flytrap jaws (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8 piercing and you
can spend an action immediately after a hit to grab the
target; Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid
• Shambling Mound vine (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8 slashing;
Speed 20 feet, swim 20 feet; resistance 10 to electricity
• Treant branch (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d10 bludgeoning;

attacks increases by 5 feet. You must have enough space to
expand into or the spell is lost. Your transformed statistics are as
follows: AC 31 (TAC 27); attack modifier +19; damage bonus +5;
24 temporary HP; Athletics +19.
POLAR RAY

You fire a blue-white ray of freezing air and swirling sleet from
your finger that can chill its target to the bones. You must
succeed at a ranged touch attack to affect the target, which then
takes 8d8 cold damage and is drained 2.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d8.
POSSESSION
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one living creature
	DURATION:concentration up to 1 minute
You send your mind and soul into the target's body, attempting
to take control, and the target must attempt a Will save. You
can choose to take the effects of a lower degree of success if
you prefer. While you're possessing a target, your true body is
unconscious and can't wake up normally.
	DESC:&nl;Success You possess the target but can't control it, riding
along in its body while the spell lasts.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -You possess the target and take partial control of it. Both
you and the target can spend actions using the target's body.

against all castings of power word kill. The effect of the spell
depends on the target's level.
14th or Lower The target dies instantly.
15th If the target had 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly;
otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and gains dying 1 or

PREPARE FOR BATTLE
	INFO:PowerLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:10 feet
	TARGETAREA:you and one ally
	DURATION:24 hours
You converse with an ally to stoke her zeal for battle, or sing
songs of righteous anger to set up a sympathetic bond. The next
time you and that ally roll initiative, you both use the higher of
your two initiative rolls. If you roll initiative, if you use this boon
again, or if either of you rests, the spell ends.

Evocation
You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you
Concentrate on the Spell. The effects are minor and have severe
limitations. Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can
choose one of four options, based on your type of magic.
• Cook (arcane, primal) Chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of
nonliving material.
• Lift (arcane, divine, occult) Slowly lift an unattended object
of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
• Make (arcane, divine, occult) Create an object of negligible
Bulk, made of congealed magical substance and temporary
in nature. The object looks crude and artificial and is
extremely fragile-it crumbles if put under too much strain
and can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
• Tidy (arcane, primal) Color, clean, or soil an object of light
or less Bulk. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10
rounds of concentration or a larger object, such as a suit of
armor, with 5 minutes of concentration.
Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions.
Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, coloring, or soiling it) persists only as long as you Concentrate
on the Spell.
PRIMAL HERD
	INFO:SpellLevel|10
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:you and up to five willing
targets
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You transform the targets into a herd of mammoths, and they
assume a Huge battle form. Each target must have enough space
to expand into or the spell fails for that target. Targets count as
animals in addition to their normal traits while in this form. The
targets' gear is absorbed into their forms; the constant abilities of
the gear still function, but targets can't activate any item abilities.
When targets transform, each target gains the following abilities:
• AC 41 (TAC 38) and ignores armor's check penalty and
Speed reduction.
• New attacks, which are the only types of attacks they
can use. They're trained with them. When attacking with
them, they use their attack modifier with the proficiency
and item bonus of their most favorable weapon or unarmed
Strike, and the damage bonus is listed with the attacks. All
attacks are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the
enfeebled condition, for example).
• 20 temporary Hit Points that go away when they leave
their battle form.
• Low-light vision.
• Athletics +28 (unless their own total modifiers are higher).
The special statistics of the battle form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
The battle form prevents the targets from casting spells, or
spending most manipulate actions that require hands (the GM
determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there's
doubt). Each target can dismiss the spell's effects on her own by
using an action (this action has the concentrate trait).
When in battle form, each target gains the attacks, movement
types, and special abilities listed below.
• Mammoth tusk (reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+9 piercing;
trunk (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+9 bludgeoning;
foot (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+3 bludgeoning;
Speed 40 feet; Trample: As a 3-action activity, you can
move up to twice your Speed and move through the space
of Large or smaller creatures, trampling each creature
whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot
damage based on a Reflex save against your spell DC (half
damage on a success, no damage on a critical success, full
damage on a failure, double damage on a critical failure).
PRIMAL PHENOMENON
	INFO:SpellLevel|10
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
You form a direct connection with the natural world and request
intercession. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and
might choose to grant a different request (potentially more
powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for.
A primal phenomenon spell can do any of the following things.
• Duplicate any primal spell of 9th level or lower.
• Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower.
• Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the
above effects.
At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon
to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be
dangerous or the spell may have only a partial effect.
PRISMATIC SPHERE
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:10 feet
	DURATION:1 hour
This multicolored sphere functions like a prismatic wall but is
shaped in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner within your space.
You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges
don't pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is lost.
PRISMATIC SPRAY
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	TARGETAREA:30-foot cone
A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand.
Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see
which beam affects it, then roll a saving throw of the indicated
type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type
of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same
d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving
throw negates the effect for that creature.

1 Red Reflex 30 fire damage (fire)
2 Orange Reflex 40 acid damage (acid)

PRISMATIC WALL
	INFO:SpellLevel|8
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet
	DURATION:1 hour or until dismissed
You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light. The
wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet across and 30 feet
high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space so its
edges don't pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is
lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall
sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side. Creatures other than
you that come into the wall's light must succeed at a Will save or
be blinded for 1 minute. A creature that attempts a save is then
bolstered against that particular prismatic wall's blinding effect.
A prismatic wall has seven different colors, each with the effect
of a 5th-level chromatic wall spell of that color. A creature that
tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against
each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so
a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a
creature for the indigo and violet walls.
The wall as a whole is immune to dispelling effects of the wall's
level or lower, but each color must be dispelled by its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't
be affected until the previous color is dispelled. Dispelling a color
wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and dispelling them
all ends prismatic wall.
PRIVATE SANCTUM
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch; Area 100-foot burst
	DURATION:24 hours
The area looks like a bank of impenetrable black fog. Sensory
stimuli (such as sounds, smells, and light) don't pass from inside
the area to outside the area. Scrying spells can't perceive any
stimuli from the area, and mind-reading effects don't work in
the area.

range of the image, and if at any point you can't see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than an aura
spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either
yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it can't

If the spell is successful, the creature is no longer dead
and returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no spells prepared, no
points in any pools, and it is still suffering from any longterm
debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the
Boneyard leaves the character temporarily debilitated, making
it enervated 2 for 1 week; this condition can't be removed or
reduced by any means until the week has passed. The creature
is also permanently changed in some way by their time in the

You attempt to learn more about the target's fate in the short
term, usually within the next day for a creature living a fairly
sedentary life, or the next hour or less for someone likely to have
multiple rapid experiences of note, such as someone actively
adventuring. You learn a single enigmatic word connected
to the creature's fate that day. Fate is notoriously fickle and
inscrutable, and the word isn't necessarily meant to be taken at
face value, so the meaning is often clear only in hindsight. The
GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check (see page 292). If the creature's
fate is too uncertain, or on a failed flat check, the spell results
in the word “inconclusive.” Either way, the creature is bolstered
against read fate.

value can't exceed 3. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its
regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.
Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During
the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach severed

REPULSION
	INFO:SpellLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:aura up to 40 feet
	DURATION:1 minute
From you extends an aura that prevents creatures from
approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the field
any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. Creatures must attempt
a Will save if they're in the aura when you cast the spell or as
soon as they enter the aura while it's in effect. Once a creature
has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting
of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply
only if it moves voluntarily toward you. For example, if you move
closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.
	DESC:&nl;Success The creature treats each square in the aura as difficult
terrain when is moving closer to you.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The creature's movement is not restricted.

RESILIENT SPHERE

You create an immobile sphere of force around the target's space
to either trap or protect it, blocking anything that would cross
through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, TAC 5, and Hardness
10. It can take 2 extra Dents and is destroyed when broken.
Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. The spell's duration
ends when the sphere is destroyed. If the target is unwilling, the
effects of the sphere depend on the target's Reflex save.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target disrupts the sphere's integrity, so the
sphere functions normally but begins with 3 Dents.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target disrupts the sphere, causing it to
collapse entirely.

RESPLENDENT MANSION
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:500 feet
	DURATION:24 hours (see text)
You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to
300 feet on a side. While casting the spell, you hold an image of
the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion
can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and it is
decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each
room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within.
Abjuration
Mental
Abjuration
Force
Abjuration
Conjuration
Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for
anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond
its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical
effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function
normally.
Your mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and
servants as created by the magnificent mansion spell.
Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are
protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is
audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each has a different
sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.
When you prepare spells, you can choose not to recover the
spell slot or daily spell you used to cast this spell. If you do, the
mansion remains for another 24 hours.
The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other
structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural
requirements for being built there. The mansion adjusts around small
features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on
water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or
other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation
reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there's a 10% chance
each day the mansion begins to sink or collapse.
The mansion doesn't harm creatures within the area when it
appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely
populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the
mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the
complete mansion and always has a clear path of escape.
RESTORATION

	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or
lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one
restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more
than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.
• Reduce a Condition Reduce the value of the target's
enfeebled, sluggish, or stupefied condition by 2. You can
instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.
• Lessen a Toxin Reduce the stage of one toxin the target
suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below
stage 1 or cure the affliction.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) Add drained to the list of conditions you can
reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You
also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's
enervated value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent
enervated condition.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) Per the 4th-level restoration, but you can
reduce a permanent enervated condition if you add a Material

RESTORE SENSES
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
You can counteract a single effect making the target blinded
or deafened. This can counteract both temporary magic and
permanent consequences of magic, but it doesn't cure someone
who is missing the sense from some natural state or effect, such
as from birth or from a nonmagical wound or toxin.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and
you can target up to 10 creatures. You can choose the effect to
counteract separately for each selected creature.

RETROCOGNITION
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 minutes
This spell allows you to gain impressions from past events
that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals
impressions from events that occurred over the course of the
last day throughout the first minute of the duration, followed
by impressions from the next day back the next minute you
concentrate, and so on. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent
event through an impression, you lose concentration on the spell
unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of 30–35, depending
on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event
is traumatic and chooses the DC.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) You gain impressions of events that occurred
over the previous year for each minute you concentrate, instead
of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it harder
to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) You gain impressions of events that occurred
over the previous century for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making
it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from all but the
most major events.
REVERSE GRAVITY
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet; Area 20-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder

secured to the ground immediately fall upward to the top of
the area. A creature might be able to Grab an Edge to arrest its fall
Abjuration
Mental
Nonlethal
Divination
Evocation
if it falls past an appropriate edge. If a creature falls against a solid
object (such as a ceiling), it takes the appropriate amount of falling
damage and lands on the surface. Once an object or creature
reaches the top of the area, it floats, caught between the normal
and reversed gravity. The creature can move along the plane
where the two forms of gravity meet. Creatures that can levitate or
fly can use those abilities to mitigate the effects of reverse gravity.
When reverse gravity ends, all creatures and objects caught in
the area fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves beyond
the bounds of the spell's area is subjected to normal gravity again.
REVIVAL
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:dead creatures and living

	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 rounds
All living targets regain Hit Points equal to 9d8 plus your
spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, you return any number
of dead targets to life temporarily, with the same effects as raise
dead and the same limitations. The resurrected creatures have a
number of temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of healing
you gave living creatures (instead of having full HP). The revived
creatures can't regain Hit Points, and once revival's duration
ends, they lose all temporary Hit Points and die. Revival can't
resurrect creatures killed by disintegrate or a death effect. It has
no effect on undead.
RIDICULOUS NOTION

	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting
	TARGETAREA:30-foot aura

You speak a phrase so absurd that it can cause creatures to
laugh. Each target must attempt a Will saving throw. A target
is bolstered against your ridiculous notion once it succeeds at its
save or once the duration ends if it fails the save.
	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target breaks into a paroxysm of laughter. It's

	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target laughs so hard it falls prone and
can't use any actions, reactions, or free actions.
RIGHTEOUS MIGHT
	INFO:SpellLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting;
Requirements You have a deity.
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You focus all your divine energy into transforming yourself into a
battle form, similar to your normal form but armed with powerful
divine armaments granted by your deity. Your gear is absorbed
into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. When you transform, you gain
the following.
• AC 27 (Touch 24) and ignore your armor's check penalty
and Speed reduction
• A special attack with a righteous armament version of your
favored weapon, which is the only type of attack you can
use. When attacking with the special weapon, your attack
modifier is +20 and your damage bonus is +4 (or +2 for a
ranged attack). Use four of your weapon's normal damage
dice, or one damage die higher if your weapon is a simple
weapon with a d4 or d6 damage die. The weapon has
one of the following properties that matches your deity's
alignment: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, unholy. If your deity
is true neutral, you instead gain access to the weapon's
critical specialization effect.
• 10 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your
battle form.
• Resistance 3 against physical damage.
• Darkvision.
• Speed of 40 feet.
• Athletics +20 unless your own total modifier is higher.
The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only
by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
Your battle form prevents you from casting spells or using most
actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the
GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if
there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this
action has the concentrate trait).
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) Your battle form is Large, your attacks have
10-foot reach or 15-foot reach if your deity's favored weapon is
a reach weapon. You must have enough space to expand into or
the spell is lost. Your transformed statistics are as follows: AC
33 (Touch 29); attack modifier of +26; five dice of damage with
a damage bonus of +5; 15 temporary HP; resistance 4 against
physical damage; Athletics of +26.
ROPE TRICK

	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one touched piece of rope
from 5 to 30 feet long
	DURATION:8 hours
You cause the target rope to rise vertically into the air. Where it
ends, an extradimensional space springs up, connected to the top
of the rope. This space can be reached only by climbing the rope.
The entrance to the space can't be seen, and it can be
pinpointed only by the presence of the rope. The rope can't
be removed or hidden, though it can be detached from the
extradimensional space by pulling it with 16,000 pounds of
weight, critically succeeding at an Athletics check against the
spell's DC, or destroying the rope. The space holds up to eight
Medium creatures and their gear. A Large creature counts as
two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium
creatures, and a Gargantuan creature fills the space on its own.
If the rope is detached or destroyed or if a creature attempts
to enter the space that would put it over its capacity, the space
begins to unravel. It disappears in 1d4 rounds, depositing the
creatures within safely on the ground below.

SANCTIFIED GROUND

	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	INFO:Cost|1 vial of holy water
	TARGETAREA:30-foot burst centered on you

You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with holy water and preparing
it to make a stand against your foes. Choose aberrations, celestials, dragons, fiends, or undead. All creatures in the area

SANCTUARY
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will
save each time, with outcomes depending on their saves. If the
target acts in a hostile manner, the spell is dismissed.
	DESC:&nl;Success The creature can attempt its attack and any other
attacks against the target this turn.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success Sanctuary is dismissed.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The creature can't attack the target and wastes the action.

SAVOR THE STING
	INFO:PowerLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
You revel in your target's pain. If you succeed at a
touch attack, your target takes 1d6 mental damage
(double damage on a critical hit) and becomes sick with pain
depending on its Will save. As long as the target is sick, you gain a +1
conditional bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target does not become sick.

SCINTILLATING PATTERN

	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting
	RANGE:120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
A field of vibrant, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must
attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you
cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or
uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently
affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.
	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is confused for 1d4 rounds.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After the
stun ends, the target is confused for the remaining duration

SCRYING
	INFO:SpellLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:planetary
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:concentration, up to 10 minutes
Scrying works like clairvoyance, except that the image you
receive is less precise (insufficient for teleport and similar spells)
and instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that appears just above the target.
You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its
possessions or a fallen piece of its body. If you haven't met the
target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware
of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown
creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.
The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.
	DESC:&nl;Success The spell fails and the target is bolstered against scrying.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The spell fails and the target is bolstered
against scrying for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse
of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The spell succeeds.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the
target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.
SEARING LIGHT
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
You shoot a blazing-hot ray of light tinged with
holy energy. Make a ranged touch attack against
the target. If you hit, you deal 4d6 fire damage. If
the target is a fiend or undead, you deal 4d6 additional good
damage to it. On a critical hit, double all the damage.
If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or
targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light
attempts to dispel the darkness. If you need to determine
whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a
line between you and the spell's target.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The fire damage by 3d6 and the good damage
against fiends and undead increases by 3d6.
SECRET PAGE
	INFO:SpellLevel|3
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch

You change the target's text to different text entirely. If the text is
a spellbook or a scroll, you can change it to show a spell you know

respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer.
SHADOW BLAST
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:varies; Area varies
You shape the mutable and quasi-real substance of the Shadow
Plane into a deadly blast. Choose acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing, and choose a 30-foot cone, a 15-foot burst within 120 feet, or a 50-foot line. The blast deals
5d8 damage of the type you chose to creatures in the area; these
creatures must attempt their choice of a Reflex or Will save.
	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Double damage.

SHADOW SIPHON
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Verbal reaction; Trigger a spell or
magical effect deals damage
	RANGE:60 feet
	TARGETAREA:the triggering spell
You transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory version
of itself. Treat this as a dispel attempt, except that if the dispel
attempt is successful, any creatures that would be damaged by
the spell instead take only half as much damage. Treat shadow
siphon's counteract level as 2 higher for this dispel attempt.
SHADOW WALK
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:you and up to nine willing
creatures touched
	DURATION:8 hours or until dismissed
The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane, where it borders
the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on
the Shadow Plane, and while on the Shadow Plane, they are
exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The
shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding
up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3
minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as
they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects
only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the
spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended
location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling
together appear together).
SHAPE STONE
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:cube of stone 10 feet across

	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a
different polymorph spell you know of 7th level or lower. You
choose the type of creature as you cast the spell rather than
when you prepare it. You can Concentrate on the Spell to change
your form to any other form you could choose with this spell.
You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the
concentrate trait).
SHIELD CANTRIP
	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting
	DURATION:until your next turn or until dismissed
You raise a magical shield of force to protect you.
This counts as using the Raise a Shield action (see the sidebar) to
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next
turn, though it doesn't require a hand to use.
While the spell is in effect, you can also use the Shield Block
reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 4. After
you use Shield Block, the spell is dismissed and you can't cast it
again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use
the spell's reaction against the magic missile spell.
Heightening the spell increases the Hardness.

take damage through this link, don't apply any resistances, weaknesses, and the like that you have to that damage; you
simple take that amount of damage. The spell is dismissed if the

your hands, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and dealing
another die of damage on a hit. Additionally, as long as you are
on your home plane, attacks you make with the target against

	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
On a hit, the target takes electricity damage
equal to 1d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. If the

The target shrinks to size Tiny. Its equipment shrinks with it, but returns to natural size if removed. The creature's reach
changes to 0 feet. This spell has no effect on a Tiny creature.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (6th) As 2nd level, but the spell can target up to
10 creatures instead of just one.

	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one nonmagical object up

	DURATION:1 day or until dismissed
You shrink the target to roughly the size of a coin. This reduces
it to negligible Bulk. You can dismiss the spell with a Verbal
	INFO:Casting|action or by tossing the object onto a solid surface.
The object can't be used to attack or cause damage when it
returns to normal size. If there isn't room for the object to
return to normal size when the spell ends, the spell's duration
continues until the object is in a location large enough to
accommodate its normal size.
SIGIL CANTRIP

	TARGETAREA:one creature or object
	DURATION:unlimited (see below)
You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about

mark can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from
one state to another by spending a Somatic Casting action
during which you touch the target.
The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of
work. If it's on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of
a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending
on your level.

The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from
noticing it using hearing. The target can't use sonic attacks, nor can it use actions with the auditory trait. (This prevents it
from casting spells that include Verbal Casting actions.)
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) The silence effect emanates from the
touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a
10-foot radius and preventing any auditory and sonic effects
in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are
subject to the effects listed above. Depending upon the
position of the effect, a creature might be able to notice the
lack of sound reaching it. For example, if the silence effect
blocks a corridor leading to a noisy party, a creature might
notice those sounds abruptly cease.
SKIN OF THORNS

Each target in the area becomes drowsy and might fall asleep, depending on its Will save. A creature that falls asleep from
this spell doesn't fall prone or drop what it's holding. This spell
doesn't prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful
Perception check, making it of limited use mid-combat.
	DESC:&nl;Success –1 conditional penalty to Perception checks for

	DESC:&nl;Critical Success Unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -It falls asleep. If it's still asleep after 1 minute, it

SPEAK WITH ANIMALS
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:10 minutes
You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the
Diplomacy skill with animals. The spell doesn't make them more
friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be
terse and evasive; less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
SPEAK WITH PLANTS
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:10 minutes
You can ask questions of and receive answers from plants, but the
spell doesn't make them more friendly or intelligent than normal.
Most normal plants have a limited and distinctive view of the world
around them, so they don't recognize details about creatures or
know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity.
Wary and cunning plant monsters are likely to be terse and
evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
SPECTRAL HAND
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet
	DURATION:1 minute
You create a semicorporeal hand out of your essence that
delivers touch spells for you. Whenever you Cast a Spell with a
range of touch, you can have the hand crawl to a target within
range along the ground, touch it, and then crawl back to you.
When making a melee touch attack with the hand, you use your
normal bonuses. The hand can move as far as it needs to within
range, and its movement doesn't trigger reactions. The hand has
your AC and saves, but any damage to the hand destroys it and
causes you to take 1d6 damage.
SPELL IMMUNITY
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:24 hours
Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the Verbal Casting
action. Spell immunity attempts to dispel that spell (see page
197) whenever spell immunity's target is the target of the named
spell or in that spell's area. Successfully dispelling a spell that
targets an area or multiple targets with spell immunity negates
the effects only for spell immunity's target.
SPELL TURNING
	INFO:SpellLevel|7
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 hour
This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster.
When a spell targets you, you can spend a reaction to have spell
turning attempt to reflect it. This works like dispelling the spell, but if the spell is successfully dispelled, the effect is turned back
on the caster. Whether or not the dispel attempt is successful, spell turning ends. Spell turning can't affect spells that aren't
targeted (such as area spells).
If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who also is
under the effect of spell turning, his spell turning can attempt to
reflect his own spell back at you again; if he does so, his dispel
attempt automatically succeeds.
SPELLWRACK
	INFO:SpellLevel|6

You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature's spirit, dealing 12d6 force damage. It must attempt a Fortitude save.
Because spirit blast affects the creature's spirit, it can damage
a target projecting its consciousness or possessing another
creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed
creature isn't harmed by the blast. The blast doesn't harm
creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.
	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.

You lay a curse on the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a
contagious trap in its spiritual essence for those who contact it.
The results depend on the target's Will save. Any creature that
casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it's affected must
also attempt a Will save as if targeted, and the curse continues
to spread in this way.
	DESC:&nl;Success Enfeebled 2 for 1 round.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target is unaffected.

SPIRITUAL GUARDIAN
	INFO:SpellLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting;
Requirements You have a deity.
	RANGE:120 feet
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
A Medium guardian made of pure magical force manifests
and attacks foes you designate within range. This guardian is
ghostly and translucent and appears to be holding your deity's
favored weapon.
When you cast the spell, the spiritual guardian appears in
an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range
and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Concentrate on
the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied
space next to a new target within range (if you choose to do so
and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes
to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you
Concentrate on the Spell, you can have the guardian move
adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time
the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10
damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you
move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different
ally or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 30 Hit Points and
can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't take
damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate
automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's TAC
of 25.
Attacks with the guardian use your attack modifier with
that type of weapon but use your spellcasting ability modifier
instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of the
weapon's appearance, the guardian deals force damage equal
to 1d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you
Strike with the guardian, you can choose to deal damage of
the normal damage type of the weapon it holds instead of force
damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile
weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even
a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A spiritual
guardian's weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances, and so forth.
The guardian takes up space and grants flanking (even with
a ranged weapon), but it doesn't have any other attributes a
creature would normally have, aside from Hit Points, and
creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The
guardian can't make any kind of attack other than a normal
Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies
do not apply to the guardian's attacks.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The guardian's damage increases by 1d10 and its

SPIRITUAL WEAPON
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting;
Requirement You must have a deity.
	RANGE:120 feet
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
A weapon made of pure magical force manifests and attacks foes
you designate within range. This weapon is ghostly and appears
as your deity's favored weapon.
When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe
of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each
time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can move the weapon to
a new target within range (if you choose to do so) and make a
Strike with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your
multiple attack penalty.
Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with
that type of weapon, but substitute your spellcasting ability
modifier instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of its
appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus
your spellcasting ability modifier. When you Strike with the
weapon, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the
weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage
types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon
apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only.
A spiritual weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances, and so forth.
The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any
other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any
kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that
affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.

You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural or
worked stone. While stone is not intelligent, you speak with the
natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality colored by
the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is
part of, for worked stone. A stone's perspective, perception, and
knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human's
that it doesn't consider the same details important. Stones can
mostly answer questions about those that touched them in the
past and what is concealed beneath them.

A massive storm cloud forms in the air in a 360-foot burst. Beneath
it, rain begins to fall, and whipping winds impose a –4 circumstance
penalty to physical ranged attacks and weapon ranged attacks.
When you cast this spell and the first time each round you
Concentrate on the Spell, you can choose one of the following
storm effects. You can't choose the same one twice in a row.
• Acid Rain Each creature in the storm takes 3d8 acid damage
with no saving throw.
• Hail The storm deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures
beneath it. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage
to half (no damage on a critical success).
• Lightning Up to 10 bolts of lightning strike down, targeting
creatures of your choice in the storm. No more than one bolt
can target any one creature. Each bolt deals 5d6 electricity
damage ( half damage on a successful Reflex save, no damage
on a critical success, and double damage on a critical failure).
• Rain and Wind Heavy rain and whipping wind reduce
visibility and mobility, making the area under the storm
cloud concealed and difficult terrain.

that succeeds is bolstered against thunderclaps from the

You suggest a course of action to the target, which must
be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course
of action to the target and can't be self-destructive or

response depends on its Will save.

	DURATION:1 minute
Ground in the area turns swampy and fetid, like an Abyssal
mire. The area is difficult terrain, but not deep enough to
require or allow swimming. The sludge at the bottom of the
morass animates into Diminutive sludge beasts with a demonic
appearance. These don't function as normal creatures, but they
swarm over creatures in the swamp and exude a noxious stench.

The target's senses are acutely rewired in unexpected ways, causing them to process noises as bursts of color, smells as

flat check each time it uses a concentrate action or reaction, or that action or reaction fails.

You advance one of the target's toxins to progress to the point that
the target needs to attempt its next saving throw. If the target is
affected by more than one toxin, you can choose from among the
toxins you are aware of; otherwise choose randomly. Against an
unwilling creature, you must hit it with a melee touch Strike. On a
willing or unconscious creature or on a critical hit against an unwilling
creature, you can grant the creature either a +2 conditional bonus or
a –2 conditional penalty to its saving throw against the toxin.
TALKING CORPSE
	INFO:SpellLevel|4

	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one corpse
	DURATION:10 minutes
You grant the corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to speak
the answers to three questions. This uses the physical body's
latent memories rather than calling back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact. The more damage it has
taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers, and it
must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has
previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist
the questions as if it were the original creature at its time of
death, with the following effects.
	DESC:&nl;Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your
questions, and the target's spirit haunts you throughout
the day, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain
any rest for 1 day.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can
be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or
attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before
you can ask all your questions.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Failure Per failure, but the target's answers are more
direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic. It takes a –2
conditional penalty to Deception checks to deceive you.

Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any
bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, climbing, or swimming within the creepers is entangled until it
leaves the area. Once per round, you can Concentrate on the Spell
to have a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of
creepers. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a melee touch
attack using your bonus. If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls
the target into the creepers and makes it immobile for 1 round
or until the creature Escapes (using your spell DC as the Escape
DC), whichever comes first.

TELEKINETIC PROJECTILE CANTRIP
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
You hurl a loose, unattended object in range at the
target. The spell gains the trait of a damage type appropriate to the
object (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). Make a ranged attack
against the target. If you hit, you deal 1d10 damage of the given
type; you deal double damage on a critical hit. No special traits or
magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or damage.
You can heighten the spell to hurl more objects, though you
attempt only one attack roll and target only one creature, and
your salvo of projectiles deals damage all at once for the purposes
of resistances, weaknesses, and the like. Only one damage type
applies regardless of how many objects you hurl.

you have established a connection by communicating with a
creature. You can communicate only with creatures that share
a language with you.

TELEPORT
	INFO:SpellLevel|6
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)

	TARGETAREA:you and up to four willing
creatures touched
You and the targets instantly transport to any location within
range, as long as you can identify the location precisely both
by its position relative to your starting position and by its
appearance. Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance
usually causes the spell to fail, but it could lead to teleporting to
an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined
by the GM.
Teleport is not precise over great distances. The targets
appear at a distance from the intended destination equal
to roughly 1% of the total distance traveled, in a direction
determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision
is irrelevant, but journeys of the maximum 100 miles are 1 mile
off target.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (7th) You and the targets can travel to any location
within 1,000 miles.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) You and the targets can travel to any location
on the same planet. If you travel more than 1,000 miles, you
arrive only 10 miles off target.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (9th) You and the targets can travel to any location
on another planet within the same solar system. Assuming
you have accurate knowledge of the location's position and
appearance, you arrive on the new planet 100 miles off target.

any planet within the same galaxy.

TIME STOP

You temporarily stop time for everything but you, allowing
you to use an incredible number of actions in a short period
of time. Immediately after casting time stop, you can use up to
9 actions in three sets of up to 3 actions each. After each set
of actions, 1 round passes, but only for you, effects specifically
targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the
stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to
your attacks, and you can't target or affect them with anything.
Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again
for the rest of the world. If you had created an effect whose
duration extends past the end of the spell, such as a wall of fire, it immediately affects others again as normal, though it doesn't
have any of the effects that normally happen when you first
cast the spell.

TREE SHAPE
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:8 hours
You transform into a Large tree. Perception checks don't reveal
your true nature, but a successful Nature or Survival check against
your spell DC reveals that the tree is new to the area. While in tree
form, you can observe everything around you, but you can't act
other than by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait)
to end the spell, which ends your turn. As a tree, your AC is 20;
your TAC is 12; and only conditional bonuses, conditional penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance penalties affect you. You
treat successes and critical successes on Reflex saves as failures.

You step into a living tree with a trunk large enough
to fit you and instantly teleport to any tree of the same species

You can see things within 60 feet as they actually are. The GM
rolls a secret dispel check against any illusion or transmutation

don't end the polymorph spell).
TRUE STRIKE
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Verbal Casting
	DURATION:until the end of your turn

creature or object and up to five willing creatures
	DURATION:1 hour
This spell grants perfect sight based on scrying, allowing subjects
to track the exact movements or position of one creature or object.
Choose one target creature or object in the area to be tracked. It
becomes the sensor for the spell. Up to five willing creatures of
your choice in the area can see a ghostly image of this creature or
object when it's out of their sight. They can perceive the creature
or object perfectly, allowing them to ignore invisibility or the
concealed condition, though physical barriers still provide cover.
The tracking creatures can see the tracked creature or object
through all barriers other than lead or running water, which block
their vision. Distance also doesn't matter, though the creature or
object might move so far away it becomes too small to perceive.
You don't scry any of the environment around the creature or
object, though you do see any gear a creature is wearing or
holding and can tell if it removes objects from its person.
If you try to track an unwilling creature, the effect depends
on its Will save.

	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute
You transform your flesh and organs into a bizarre amalgam
of glistening skin, rough scales, tufts of hair, and tumorous
protuberances. This has three effects:
• You gain resistance 10 to precision damage and resistance
10 to extra damage from critical hits. If the resistance
is greater than the extra damage, it reduces the extra
damage to 0 but doesn't reduce the attack's normal
damage. Any creature attacking you should calculate the
normal damage and extra damage separately while your
anatomy is altered.
• You gain darkvision.
• Acid oozes from your skin. Any creature that hits you with
an unarmed attack or with a non-reach weapon takes 2d6
acid damage.

VEIL
	INFO:SpellLevel|4
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:up to 10 creatures
	DURATION:1 hour or until dismissed
You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same body
shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight
(within 50 pounds). The disguise can hide the targets' identities
or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but it's not good
enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn't
change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for
each target, so you could make one appear to be a dwarf and
another an elf, for example.
	INFO:Casting|veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of
the Impersonate action. It ignores any circumstance penalties
the targets might take for being disguised as a dissimilar
creature, and it also gives the targets a +4 conditional bonus to
Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their
disguises. You can dismiss any or all of these disguises with a
Verbal Casting action.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (5th) The spell also disguises the targets' voices and
scents, gaining the auditory trait.

You surround yourself in a veil of confidence, causing fear
to slide off you as long as the veil lasts. Reduce your current
frightened condition by 1, and whenever you would become
frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you
critically fail a saving throw against a fear effect during the
duration, veil of confidence ends immediately and you increase
the frightened condition you gain from the critical failure by 1
instead of decreasing it.
VENTRILOQUISM
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute
Whenever you speak, you can make your voice seem to come
from somewhere else within 30 feet. Any creature that hears the
sound can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (2nd) The spell's duration increases to 1 hour, and you can also change the tone, quality, and other aspects

light. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature
must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when

uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently
blinded by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.
	DESC:&nl;Success Unaffected.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -The target is blinded by the pattern. If it exits the
pattern, it gets a new save to recover from the blindness
at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of

within 1 foot of a surface you touch (such as on the other side

If you have a pool of Spell Points, when the spell's duration
ends, you can spend 1 Spell Point as a free action to extend the
duration for another minute.
VISIONS OF DANGER

	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
	DURATION:1 minute
An illusion of horrific otherworldly creatures appears within the
spell's area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters, with a specific appearance of your choice, such as hellish flies or
animated saw blades. Any creature that's inside the burst when
it's created, enters the burst, or ends its turn inside the burst
must attempt a Will save to avoid taking 8d8 mental damage. A
creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one
with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion.

	RANGE:120 feet; Area 5-foot radius, 80-foot-tall
cylinder
The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the
air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 13d6 fire damage. Creatures in
the area must attempt a Reflex save or take 13d6 fire damage.
The lava rapidly cools, and creatures in the area might become
partially encased in rock depending on their Reflex saves. A
creature encased in rock is sluggish 1, is hampered 5 feet, and when flying treats all normal terrain as difficult terrain. A
flying creature immediately descends 20 feet the moment it's
encased, but doesn't take falling damage from this movement.
A creature encased in rock can attempt to Break Open or
Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the
creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.
	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage and not encased.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success No damage and not encased.
	DESC:&nl;Failure -Full damage and encased.

	DURATION:1 minute
You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet
across and up to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible
thickness. If the wall's surface would be broken by any creature
or object, the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness
23, and it can take 3 additional Dents before being broken. If the
wall is broken, the spell ends. The wall blocks physical effects
from passing through it, and because it's made of force, it blocks
incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects
can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall
is invisible).
Wall of force is immune to dispelling effects of its level or
lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by a disintegrate
spell of any level or by contact with a sphere of annihilation or
rod of cancellation.

of ice in a straight line (the wall doesn't have to be vertical but
it must be anchored on both sides to a solid surface) or a 1-footthick, 10-foot hemisphere of ice. The ice that makes up the
wall is opaque. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length, height, or radius. You must evoke the wall in an unbroken open
space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, TAC
8, and Hardness 13. Each section is immune to cold and water.
A section also has weakness to fire 15; a section of the wall
broken by fire is completely destroyed immediately, melting
and evaporating into water and steam. A section broken or
destroyed by means other than fire can be moved through as
difficult terrain and deals 2d6 cold damage to anyone passing
through it.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (+2) The Hardness of each section of the wall
increases by 4 and the cold damage for crossing a broken or
destroyed section increases by 1d6.

	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:120 feet
You create a 1-inch-thick, 120-foot-long, and 20-foot-high wall of
stone. You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the
wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to
stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open
space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects or
the spell is lost. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC
10, TAC 6, and Hardness 17. A broken section of the wall can be
moved through, but rubble created from it is difficult terrain.

of brambles and thorns in a straight line. The wall stands
vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or
height. Everything on each side of the wall has cover from
creatures on the opposite side, and the wall's space counts as
difficult terrain. For every move action a creature uses that
enters at least one of the wall's spaces, that creature takes 3d4
piercing damage.
Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness 9. A broken section can be moved through freely.

can see clearly though it and it does not hamper sight. The wall has
the following effects.
Physical ranged attacks, such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other similarly sized ammunition, can't pass through the
wall. Attacks from bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, take a –2 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their path

effects that don't create physical objects pass through the wall
without trouble.
Creatures attempting to move overland through the wall treat
it as difficult terrain. Gases, including creatures in gaseous form, can't pass through the wall.
A creature that spends a move action to attempt to fly through

WEAPON OF JUDGMENT
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting;
Requirements You have a deity.
	RANGE:100 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 minute
An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above
the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of
your deity's favored weapon. Name war or peace when you cast
this spell.
If you name war, the weapon Strikes the target at the end of
each of its turns that the target failed to act in a hostile manner
against a particular creature. You mentally choose one creature
when you name war, and the target instinctively knows which
creature it is. This must be a creature both you and the target
can see.
If you name peace, the weapon Strikes the target each time
the target acts in a hostile manner against you or one of your
allies. You mentally choose up to five allies when you name
Transmutation
Transmutation
Abjuration
Consecration
Evocation
Force
peace, and the target instinctively knows who those allies are.
The weapon Strikes only once per act, even if the act targets
multiple allies.
Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with that
type of weapon, but they substitute your spellcasting ability
modifier instead of the normal ability score. Regardless of its
appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus
your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple
attack penalty, but has its own rather than using yours.
When you Strike with the weapon, you can deal damage of
the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage
(or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No
other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon
attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment counts as
a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.
The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any
other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any
kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that
affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (10th) The force damage increases by 1d10.

The weapon magically multiplies into duplicates that swipe at all
creatures in either a cone or an aura, dealing four dice of damage
to creatures in the area. This damage has the same type as the
chosen weapon and uses the same die size. Determine the die
size as if you were attacking with the weapon; for instance, if
you were wielding a two-hand weapon in both hands, you'd use
its two-hand damage die. Each creature in the area must attempt
a Reflex save.
	DESC:&nl;Success Half damage.
	DESC:&nl;Critical Success Unaffected.

the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing
damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5 and TAC 5, and it
automatically fails its saving throws.

web, it must attempt an Athletics check against your spell DC to
avoid being entangled or immobilized. A creature that gets out of
the web ceases to be entangled by it.

creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell
is cast or when the creature first enters the area. It keeps the
results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area.

normally respond with a lie, or they might be evasive as long as
they remain within the boundaries of the truth.
