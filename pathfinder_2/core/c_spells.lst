Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to awake if it succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger the alarm when moving into the area.

ANIMAL MESSENGER
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:120 feet
	DURATION:1 week
	DESC:You offer a gift of food, and an ordinary Tiny wild animal within range approaches to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you within the animal. Optionally, you can attach a small object or note up to light Bulk to it.

ANT HAUL
	INFO:SpellLevel|1
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting Verbal Casting

ANTIMAGIC FIELD
	INFO:SpellLevel|8
	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	TARGETAREA:10-foot aura
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
	DESC:Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells-such as dispel magic-can't affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are outside). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and function when the item exits; the ability boost from a potent item isn't suppressed. Spells of a higher level than the antimagic field overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field. The field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a master-quality longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an antimagic field.
ARCANE COUNTERMEASURE
	INFO:PowerLevel|5
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting; Trigger A creature within range that you can see casts a spell.
	RANGE:120 feet
	TARGETAREA:the spell cast by the triggering creature
	DESC:You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets gain a +1 conditional bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum (if any). For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level.
ARTISTIC FLOURISH
	INFO:PowerLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one item or work of art
	DURATION:24 hours
	DESC:You infuse the target with artisanal and artistic vision. Its quality increases to match your proficiency rank in Crafting, to a maximum of expert. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so it can't be sold for more than normal. This doesn't allow you to use the target to Craft a magic item that requires the new quality or perform any other task requiring a permanent item of that quality.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (4th) If you spend 1 additional Spell Point, the maximum quality increases to master.
	DESC:&nl;Heightened (8th) If you spend 2 additional Spell Points, the maximum quality increases to legendary.

AUGURY
	INFO:SpellLevel|2
	INFO:Casting|10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)
	DESC:You ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future, and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes. • Weal The results will be good. • Woe The results will be bad. • Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad. • Nothing There won't be particularly good or bad results. The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a “nothing” result is accurate. If anyone casts augury on the same topic, use the secret roll result from the first casting. It's possible to get a different result if circumstances change.
AVATAR
	INFO:SpellLevel|10
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	DURATION:1 minute or until dismissed
	DESC:You transform into an avatar of your deity, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You count as a deity in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate it. When you transform, you gain the following: • AC 42 (TAC 39), ignore armor's check penalty and reduced Speed. • One or more attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +31 and the damage bonus is listed. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purposes of enfeebled, for example) unless they have the finesse trait, and all ranged attacks are Dexterity based. They target the enemy's AC. Even if they deal positive or negative damage, they don't heal creatures. • 30 temporary Hit Points while you have the form. • Darkvision. • Athletics bonus of +31 unless your own bonus is higher. These statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. This form prevents spellcasting and most manipulate actions that require hands (the GM decides if there's doubt). You can dismiss the spell with a concentrate action. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, Speeds, and special abilities listed for your deity below. • Abadar Speed 50 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized, burrow Speed 30 feet; crossbow (range 120 feet, reload 1), Damage 6d10+3 piercing. • Asmodeus Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; mace (reach 15 feet), Damage 6d10+6 bludgeoning; hellfire (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 fire. • Calistria Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; whip (disarm, finesse nonlethal, reach 20 feet), Damage 6d4+6 slashing; savored sting (range 60 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Cayden Cailean Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain (and greater), air walk; rapier (deadly, reach 15), Damage 6d6+6 piercing; ale splash (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Desna Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; starknife (agile, deadly, finesse, reach 15, silver, thrown 60), Damage 6d4+6 piercing; moonbeam (range 120 feet, silver), Damage 6d6+3 fire. • Erastil Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain (and greater), air walk; longbow (deadly, range 150), Damage 6d8+3 piercing. • Gorum Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized; greatsword (versatile P, reach 15), Damage 6d12+6 slashing. • Gozreh fly Speed 70 feet, swim Speed 70 feet, no land Speed; ignore difficult terrain (and greater); wind (versatile electricity, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 bludgeoning; waves Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning (bull rush, reach 15, thrown 20). • Iomedae Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; shield (15 Hardness, can't be dented or broken); longsword (versatile piercing, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 slashing. • Irori Speed 80 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; unfettered strike (agile, versatile S or P, finesse, reach 15), Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning; wind strike (range 60), Damage 6d4+6 bludgeoning. • Lamashtu Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; falchion (forceful, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d10+6 slashing; waters of Lamashtu, (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Nethys Speed 70 feet, immune hampered, air walk; raw magic (versatile cold, electricity, fire, range 120), Damage 6d6 force. • Norgorber Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, air walk; short sword (agile, finesse, versatile slashing, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+6 piercing; blackfinger toss (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 poison. • Pharasma Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; dagger (agile, finesse, reach 15 feet, thrown 40 feet), Damage 6d6+6 slashing; spiral blast (range 120 feet, damages only undead, Damage 6d8+3 positive). • Rovagug Speed 50 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized, burrow Speed 30 feet; jaws (reach 15 feet), Damage 6d12+6 piercing; leg (agile, versatile piercing, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning. • Sarenrae Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 70 feet; scimitar (forceful, nonlethal, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d6+6 slashing; everflame (nonlethal, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 fire. • Shelyn Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, air walk; glaive (deadly, nonlethal, reach 20 feet), Damage 6d8+6 slashing; melody of inner beauty, (nonlethal, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 sonic. • Torag Speed 50 feet, immune to hampered and immobilized, burrow Speed 30 feet; shield (15 Hardness, can't be dented or broken); warhammer (bull rush, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 bludgeoning. • Urgathoa Speed 70 feet, immune to hampered, air walk; scythe (deadly, trip, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d10+6 slashing; pallid plague (range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3 negative. • Zon-Kuthon Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, air walk; spiked chain (disarm, trip, reach 15 feet), Damage 6d8+6 slashing; midnight pain (mental, nonlethal, range 120 feet), Damage 6d6+3.

	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting; Trigger A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.
	RANGE:120 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute
	DESC:The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with an appropriate fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd-for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage-the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion.

It has no magic items except weapon potency runes. The duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target's normal damage but don't apply added effects, since it doesn't have special abilities. The spell automatically ends if its HP drop to 0. The duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. You can attempt to command it as if you used Command a Minion as part of your action to Concentrate on the Spell, but the GM determines whether the creature follows your command. The duplicate is imperfect, so each turn after it takes its actions, it loses 8d6 Hit Points. It's not a living creature, and it can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way.
	DESC:&nl;Success The duplicate deals half damage with its Strikes and is destroyed at the end of the second round after it takes actions.

	INFO:Casting|Material Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:30 feet
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:see text
	DESC:You quiet the target's voice, preventing it from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn't prevent the target from talking or performing Verbal Casting actions, but no creature more than 10 feet away can hear its croaking whispers without a successful Perception check against forced quiet's DC, which might interfere with auditory or lingual effects as well as communication. The duration depends on the target's Fortitude save, and the target is bolstered against your forced quiet.

FORESIGHT
	INFO:SpellLevel|9
	INFO:Casting|Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 hour
	DESC:You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect. While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2 conditional bonus to initiative rolls and can't be flat-footed. In addition, you gain the following reaction. Foresight Trigger: The target of foresight defends against a hostile creature or other danger. Effect: The target rolls two dice and uses the higher result if it's being forced to roll (like with a saving throw), or the attacker or danger must roll twice and use the lower result (like with an attack or skill check). This is a fortune effect if the target is rolling twice, or a misfortune effect if the hostile force is. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one foresight spell in effect at a time. Casting foresight again dismisses the previous foresight.
