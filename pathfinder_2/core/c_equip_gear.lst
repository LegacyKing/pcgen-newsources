Alchemist's Tools
These beakers and chemicals can be used to set up a mobile
alchemical laboratory. Expert-quality alchemist's tools give
a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to create alchemical
items, and master-quality ones give a +2 item bonus.
Artisan's Tools
You can create items from raw materials using artisan's
tools. This involves using the Crafting skill to Craft the
items. Expert artisan's tools give you a +1 item bonus to
the check, and master tools give you a +2 item bonus.
Different sets might be needed for different kinds of work,
as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith's tools
differ from woodworker's tools.
Backpack
A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you
are carrying or stowing a backpack rather than wearing it
on your back, it has light Bulk instead of negligible.
Basic Crafter's Book
This book contains the formulas (see page 188) for all the
common items in this chapter.
Belt Pouch
A belt pouch can hold up to 4 items of light Bulk.
Caltrops
These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to
a creature's feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty
square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first
creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC
14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1
persistent bleed damage. A creature taking bleed damage
from caltrops is hampered 5. Spending an Interact action
to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the
bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops,
enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving
into the square are safe.
Deployed caltrops can be salvaged to be used again if
no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough
caltrops are ruined that they can't be salvaged.
Candle
A lit candle sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius.
Chest
A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items.
Climbing Kit
This satchel includes 50 feet of hemp rope, some pulleys,
a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set
of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself
to the wall you're climbing, moving half as quickly as
usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5
flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall.
You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb
while utilizing an expert climbing kit. A single kit has
only enough materials for one climber; each climber
needs their own kit.
Clothing
Ordinary clothing is functional and decently tailored, such
as peasant garb, monk's robes, traveler's attire, or work
clothes. Fine clothing suits a noble or royal, made with
expensive fabrics, precious metals, and intricate patterns.
Winter clothing grants a +1 item bonus to Survival checks
to Survive in the Wild when enduring cold.
Compass
A compass gives you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks
to navigate, provided you're in a location with uniform
magnetic fields.
Crowb ar, Expert
This item grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks
to Break Open anything that can be pried open.
Disguise Kit
This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need
a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate
someone using the Deception skill. A disguise kit of expert
quality adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks, and a
master disguise kit adds a +2 item bonus. If you've crafted
a large number of disguises, you can replenish your
cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics of a level of
quality that matches that of your disguise kit.
Fishing Tackle
This kit include a collapsible fishing pole, fishhooks,
line, lures, and a fishing net. Expert-quality fishing tackle
grants a +1 item bonus to checks to fish.
Flint and Steel
Flint and steel are useful in creating a fire if you have the
time to catch a spark, though using them is typically too
time-consuming to be possible during an encounter. Even
in ideal conditions, using flint and steel to light a flame
requires at least 3 actions, and often significantly longer.
Formula Book
A formula book holds formulas necessary to make items
other than the common equipment from this chapter.
Each formula book can hold the formulas for up to 100
different items. Formulas can also appear on parchment
sheets, tablets, and almost any other medium, and there's
no need for you to copy them into a specific book as long
as you can reference them.
Healer's Tools
This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary
for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid, Treat a
Disease, or Treat a Poison. Expert-quality healer's tools
provide a +1 item bonus to such checks.
Holly and Mistletoe
Plants of supernatural significance provide a divine focus
for some primal spellcasters, such as druids, to use certain
abilities and cast some spells. A bundle of holly and
mistletoe must be held in one hand to use it.
Lantern
A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1 pint of oil to
function for 6 hours. A bull's-eye lantern emits its light in
a 60-foot cone. A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30-foot
radius and is equipped with shutters, which you can
close to block the light. Closing or opening the shutters
takes an Interact action and requires you to have one
hand free.
Lock
Picking a standard lock requires three successful DC 20
Thievery checks. An expert-quality lock requires four
successes at DC 25, and a master lock requires five
successes at DC 30.
Magnifying Glass, Expert
This handheld lens gives you a +1 item bonus to Perception
checks to notice minute details of documents, fabric, and
the like.
Manacles
Binding a creature in manacles requires one successful
touch attack to bind each wrist or ankle. A creature is
normally untrained with manacle touch attacks. A twolegged
creature with its legs bound is hampered 15, and a
two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed
at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action
or else that action fails. A creature bound to a stationary
object is immobile. For creatures with more or fewer limbs,
the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any.
Freeing a creature from manacles requires three successful
DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. Expert-quality
manacles require four successes at DC 27, and masterquality
manacles require five successes at DC 32.
Material Component Pouch
This pouch contains material components for those spells
that require them. Though the components are used up
over time, you can refill spent components during your
daily preparations.
Musical Instrument
Handheld instruments include bagpipes, a small set
of chimes, small drums, fiddles and viols, flutes and
recorders, small harps, lutes, trumpets, and similar-sized
instruments. The GM might rule that an especially large
handheld instrument (like a tuba) has greater Bulk. Heavy
instruments such as large drums, a full set of chimes, and
keyboard instruments are less portable, and generally
need to be stationary while played. An expert instrument
gives a +1 item bonus to Performance checks using that
instrument, and a master instrument gives a +2 item bonus.
Oil
You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a
pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend
an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with
another action as a ranged touch attack. If you hit, it
splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you
target. You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check for the oil
to ignite successfully when it hits. If the oil ignites, the
target takes 1d6 fire damage.
Piton
These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing
easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and
use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand.
Religious Symbol
This piece of wood or silver is emblazoned with an
image representing a deity. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious symbol of their deity as a
divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A
religious symbol must be held in one hand to use it.
Religious Text
This manuscript contains scripture of a particular religion.
Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious
text as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some
spells. A religious text must be held in one hand to use it.
Repair Kit
A repair kit allows you to perform simple repairs while
traveling. It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking
tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and
wood. You can use a repair kit to Repair items using the
Crafting skill. An expert repair kit gives you a +1 item
bonus to the check.
Sack
A sack can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items. A sack
containing 2 Bulk or less can be worn on the body, usually
tucked into a belt. You can carry a sack with one hand,
but you must use two hands to transfer items in and out.
Sadd lebags
Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold up to 3 Bulk
worth of items. The Bulk value given is for saddlebags
worn by a mount. If you are carrying or stowing
saddlebags, they counts as 1 Bulk instead of light Bulk.
Satchel
A satchel can hold up to 2 Bulk worth of items. If you are
carrying or stowing a satchel rather than wearing it over
your shoulder, it counts as light Bulk instead of negligible.
Scr oll Case
Scrolls, maps, and other rolled documents are stored in
scroll cases for safe transport.
Sheath
A sheath or scabbard lets you easily carry a weapon on
your person.
Signal Whistle
When sounded, a signal whistle can be heard clearly up to
half a mile away in open country.
Snare Kit
This kit contains tools and ingredients for creating snares.
A snare kit allows you to Craft snares using the Crafting
skill. An expert snare kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the
check and a master kit gives you a +2 item bonus.
Spellbook
A spellbook holds the written knowledge necessary to
learn and prepare various spells, a necessity for wizards
and a useful luxury for other spellcasters looking to
discover additional spells. Each spellbook can hold up to
100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank spellbook.
Spyglass
A typical spyglass lets you see things eight times farther
than normal. A spyglass of expert quality adds a +1 item
bonus to Perception checks to notice details at a distance.
Tack
Tack includes all the gear required to outfit a riding
animal, including a saddle, bit and bridle, and stirrups
if necessary. Especially large or oddly shaped animals
might require specialty saddles. These can be more
expensive or hard to find, as determined by the GM.
The Bulk value given is for worn tack. If carried, the
Bulk increases to 2.
Ten-Foot Pole
When wielding this long pole, you can use Seek to search
a square up to 10 feet away. The pole is not sturdy enough
to use as a weapon.
Thieves' Tools
You need thieves' tools to Pick Locks or Disable Devices
(of some types) using the Thievery skill. Thieves' tools
of expert quality add a +1 item bonus to checks to Pick
Locks and Disable Devices, and master thieves' tools
add a +2 item bonus. Replacement picks are necessary
when your tools break as a result of a critical failure on
a Thievery check.
Tool
This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that don't
have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel, or
sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook,
or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an
improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool
or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage
type that's appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.
Torc h
A torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius. It can be
used as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4 bludgeoning
damage plus 1 fire damage.
Vial
A simple glass vial holds up to 1 ounce of liquid.
Writing Set
Using a writing set, you can draft correspondence and
scribe scrolls. A set includes stationery, including a
variety of paper and parchment, as well as ink, a quill or
inkpen, sealing wax, and a simple seal. If you've written
a large amount, you can refill your kit with extra ink
and paper.
