# Superstition Instinct
Anathema						KEY:Superstition Instinct ~ Anathema							CATEGORY:Class Feature	SORTKEY:Class Feature Instinct ~ 1	TYPE:Superstition Instinct		DESC:Willingly accepting the effects of magic spells (including from scrolls, wands, and the like), even from your allies, is anathema to your instinct. You can still drink potions, and you can still invest and activate most magic items you find, though items that cast spells are subject to the same restrictions as all other spells. If an ally insists on using magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel with that ally counts as willingly accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and thus is also anathema to your instinct.
Superstitious Resistance (Instinct Ability)	KEY:Superstition Instinct ~ Superstitious Resistance (Instinct Ability)		CATEGORY:Class Feature	SORTKEY:Class Feature Instinct ~ 2	TYPE:Superstition Instinct		DESC:While raging, you gain a +2 conditional bonus to all saves against magic.
Raging Resistance					KEY:Superstition Instinct ~ Raging Resistance					CATEGORY:Class Feature	SORTKEY:Class Feature Instinct ~ 3	TYPE:Superstition Instinct		DESC:Choose two associated magical traditions: arcane and occult, arcane and primal, divine and occult, or divine and primal. The resistance from your raging resistance class feature applies against all damage you take from spells of these two traditions of magic, regardless of the type of damage dealt by the spell.

Superstition Instinct	KEY:Barbarian Class Feature ~ Instinct ~ Superstition Instinct	CATEGORY:Class Feature	SORTKEY:Class Feature Instinct ~ 0	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.Class Feature.Display.Barbarian Instinct	DESC:A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters. Whether you're a member of a superstitious tribe that distrusts magic, a survivor of a magical accident that left your mind and body with an intense aversion to magic, or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those of other instincts.
